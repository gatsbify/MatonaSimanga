            A geographic information system (GIS) integrates hardware, software,
            and data for capturing, managing, analyzing, and displaying all
            forms of geographically referenced information. GIS allows us to
            view, understand, question, interpret, and visualize data in many
            ways that reveal relationships, patterns, and trends in the form of
            maps, globes, reports, and charts.{' '}

            Geographical information systems (GIS) are computerised systems used
            for the collection, storage, analysis, manipulation and presentation
            of complex geographical information, relevant to most sectors of
            government and commerce. Previously, this would have been a
            combination of electronic versions of traditional paper maps and
